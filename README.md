## Incremental Backup

### Description

Backup from a folder and its subfolders to another. The code checks for date last modified and only backs up newer files. This is much quicker than a "copy and paste". Vestigial files will remain in the backup folder and this can be very useful.

Thanks to other PSC contributors including Pietro Cecchi whose .bas module I used.

Experienced users might remove some of the visual feedback features to improve speed. I have also modified a version to remove user input in order to backup a selected folder using Microsoft Scheduler. Hope it is useful.
